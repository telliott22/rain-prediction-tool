# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a rain prediction tool project in early planning stages. The repository currently contains:

- **BRAINSTORM.md**: Raw ideas and inspiration for the project
- **SPEC.md**: Structured specification and planning templates with prompts for defining the application
- **TASKS.md**: Task planning templates for organizing development sessions

## Development Workflow

This project follows a structured planning approach:

1. **Brainstorming Phase**: Use BRAINSTORM.md to capture raw ideas and thoughts
2. **Specification Phase**: Use SPEC.md templates to define users, features, technology choices, and fidelity level
3. **Task Planning Phase**: Use TASKS.md templates to break down work into manageable development sessions

## Key Files

- **SPEC.md**: Contains detailed prompt templates for defining application requirements, including user needs, fidelity levels, form factors, key features, and technology choices
- **TASKS.md**: Contains prompt templates for planning development sessions, including stage identification (environment setup, development loop, core functionality, polish)
- **BRAINSTORM.md**: Space for unstructured idea capture

## Development Stages

The project follows a four-stage development progression:
1. **Environment Setup**: Proving tools and basic setup work
2. **Development Loop**: Establishing save/build/test/deploy cycle
3. **Core Functionality**: Building main user-facing features
4. **Polish & Refinement**: Improving reliability and user experience

## Session Management

Each development session should:
- Focus on one manageable chunk of work
- End with updating SPEC.md based on implementation
- End with updating documentation based on implementation
- Maintain incremental progress that builds confidence

## Project Planning Philosophy

This codebase emphasizes:
- AI-first development with structured planning
- Incremental progress through well-defined stages
- Regular reflection and spec updates
- Balancing user needs with technical constraints
