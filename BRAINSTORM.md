# Project Brainstorm

A space to dump all your ideas, thoughts, and inspiration. No structure required.

## Raw Ideas & Thoughts

<!-- 
Voice record, dictate, copy-paste, or just type your thoughts here.
Don't worry about organization - that comes later in SPEC.md
-->


- How do we know exactly where the user is? Geo from IP address


- other functionality:
   - Show another place in the world that has the exact same weather at that moment?
- another place in the world with opposite weather?
- change the styling of the entire website based on the weather?


- is this useful? 

- make it so simple that it's a sharable link? Can share with friends?
